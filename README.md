# Implementation-of-Simple-Linear-Regression-Model-for-Predicting-the-Marks-Scored

## AIM:
To write a program to predict the marks scored by a student using the simple linear regression model.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm

 1. Use the standard libraries in python for Gradient Design. 
 2. Set variables for assigning dataset values and Import linear regression from sklearn.
 3. Assign the points for representing the graph.Predict the regression for marks by using the representation of the graph.
 4. Compare the graphs and hence we obtained the linear regression for the given data.

## Program:

## Result:
Thus the program to implement the simple linear regression model for predicting the marks scored is written and verified using python programming.
